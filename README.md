# STM32-PropellerClock

STM32F411 based propeller clock made with @dfantonio for a school project in 2017.\

The clock would receive strings send by a simple GUI via bluetooth and display them as shown in the image. 

## Observations
- The code in this project is far from perfect, but it works ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \
However, given that this was ours first "big" project, it's ok.
- The original PCB was cannibalized for other school projects and I've lost the design files :( \
But the original design was not well balanced, we had to use coins and the battery that powered the micro-controller to compensate (Gambiarra at it's finest).
- The GUI code was lost has well :/ 
- This project was not very well polished due to time constraints at the time (Again, gambiarra at it's finest. Or you could say we used eXtreme Go Horse without even knowing LOL).
